# SalePilot POS & Inventory — Quick Pilot Deployment Guide

This guide shows the fastest way to get both the backend (API) and the frontend (Vite React app) running for a pilot, locally and in the cloud.

If you follow the "Quick Local Pilot" you can be running in under 10 minutes.

---

## What’s in this repo
- Frontend (Vite + React) — root folder
  - Dev: `npm run dev` (Vite on port 5173 by default)
  - Build: `npm run build` → static files in `dist/`
- Backend (Node + Express + PostgreSQL) — `backend/`
  - Dev: `npm run dev` (ts-node-dev)
  - Build: `npm run build` then `npm start` (from `dist/`)
  - Auto-migrations: `backend/src/init_db.ts` runs automatically on boot to create/alter required tables
- Database: PostgreSQL (one env var: `DATABASE_URL`)

Key URLs/endpoints:
- Backend health: `GET /api/health` (responds with `{ status: 'OK' }`)
- Uploads (images/files): served from `GET /uploads/...`

Frontend API base URL is controlled at build/runtime via `VITE_API_URL` (defaults to `http://localhost:5000/api` if not provided).

---

## Quick Local Pilot (fastest)

Prereqs:
- Node.js LTS (v18+ recommended)
- PostgreSQL connection (Docker or a managed/free instance like Railway/Neon/Supabase)

1) Create a PostgreSQL database
- Option A – Docker (local):
  - `docker run --name salepilot-pg -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_DB=salepilot -p 5432:5432 -d postgres:16`
  - Your `DATABASE_URL`: `postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/salepilot`
- Option B – Managed (Railway/Neon/Supabase):
  - Create a Postgres database and copy the connection string (use SSL if required by the provider).

2) Start the backend
- From project root:
  - `cd backend`
  - Create `backend/.env`:
    - DATABASE_URL=postgres://USER:PASS@HOST:5432/DBNAME
    - PORT=5000
    - JWT_SECRET=any-long-random-string
    - GEMINI_API_KEY=optional-if-using-AI-features
  - Install and run:
    - `npm ci` (or `npm install`)
    - Dev (auto-reload): `npm run dev`
    - Or production build: `npm run build` then `npm start`
- On first boot, the backend will run minimal idempotent migrations (init_db.ts) to create/adjust tables.
- Verify: open http://localhost:5000/api/health → should return OK.

3) Start the frontend
- From project root:
  - Create `.env.local` (root):
    - VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
  - Install and run:
    - `npm ci` (or `npm install`)
    - Dev: `npm run dev` (shows local URL like http://localhost:5173)
    - Production preview (after build): `npm run build` then `npm run preview`

You should now be able to log in and use the app. The frontend will call the backend at `VITE_API_URL`.

## Quick Cloud Pilot (zero DevOps)

Below are copy-paste steps for popular hosts. Pick one Backend option and one Frontend option.

### Backend — Render (step-by-step, backend first)

This section walks you through deploying ONLY the backend API to Render. You can hook up the frontend later by pointing VITE_API_URL to your Render URL.

Prerequisites:
- A GitHub repo with this code pushed
- A Render account (free tier works)

Step 1 — Create the Web Service
- In the Render dashboard → New → Web Service
- Connect your GitHub and select this repository
- Name: salepilot-backend (or any name)
- Root Directory: backend
- Runtime: Node 18+ (default is fine)
- Build Command: npm ci && npm run build
- Start Command: npm start
- Auto Deploy: Yes (recommended)
- Click Create Web Service (this will fail if DATABASE_URL isn’t set yet; we’ll add it next)

Step 2 — Provision PostgreSQL on Render
- In another tab of Render: New → PostgreSQL → Create Database
- After creation, open the DB and copy the Internal Connection String (recommended on Render). It typically looks like:
  postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DBNAME
  - Some providers require SSL. If yours does, you can add ?sslmode=require to the end, e.g., postgres://.../DBNAME?sslmode=require

Step 3 — Configure environment variables on the Web Service
- Open your Web Service → Settings → Environment → Add Environment Variable:
  - DATABASE_URL = <paste your Postgres connection string>
  - JWT_SECRET = a-long-random-string
  - GEMINI_API_KEY = <optional, only if using AI features>
  - Note: Render injects PORT automatically; the app uses process.env.PORT so no need to set it manually.
- Save Changes

Step 4 — Redeploy
- Go to the Web Service → Deploys → Trigger Deploy (or allow auto-deploy on push)
- Watch Logs → you should see:
  - Compiling TypeScript during build
  - On start: "Server is running" and database initialization logs from src/init_db.ts

Step 5 — Verify the API is live
- The service URL will look like: https://<your-service-name>.onrender.com
- Open the health check in your browser:
  https://<your-service-name>.onrender.com/api/health
  You should see: { "status": "OK", "timestamp": "..." }
- Or test with curl:
  curl -s https://<your-service-name>.onrender.com/api/health

Step 6 — Notes and operational tips
- CORS: The backend currently allows all origins (origin: '*'). Fine for pilots; you can lock it down later in backend/src/index.ts.
- Uploads: Files under /uploads are served by the server but Render’s disk is ephemeral. For production, use S3 or similar. For pilots, this is usually acceptable.
- Cold starts: Free tier may sleep; the first request after inactivity can take a few seconds.

Troubleshooting (Render)
- Build fails (tsc not found): It’s a devDependency and will install during npm ci. Ensure Build Command is exactly: npm ci && npm run build
- Port errors: Don’t hardcode PORT. The app already reads process.env.PORT so it will bind to Render’s provided port.
- DB auth/connection errors: Verify DATABASE_URL. If your DB requires SSL, add ?sslmode=require to the URL. Some providers also need ssl=true; consult your DB provider docs.
- Init DB errors: The initializer is idempotent and runs inside a transaction. Check logs for the first failing statement to identify a mismatch.
- 404/500 on health: Confirm that the service deployed successfully and that your route is /api/health.

Next: connect the frontend
- When you deploy the frontend (e.g., Vercel), set VITE_API_URL to:
  https://<your-service-name>.onrender.com/api
- Locally, to test against Render backend, create .env.local at the project root with:
  VITE_API_URL=https://<your-service-name>.onrender.com/api

### Backend — Railway (very quick)
1) Create a new Railway project → Provision a PostgreSQL plugin.
2) Add a new “Service” from GitHub pointing to this repo.
   - Service root directory: `backend`
   - Build: `npm ci && npm run build`
   - Start: `npm start`
3) Add environment variables:
   - DATABASE_URL (Railway provides a Postgres URL)
   - JWT_SECRET
   - GEMINI_API_KEY (optional)
4) Deploy and test `GET /api/health`.

### Frontend — Vercel (recommended for Vite)
This repo includes a `vercel.json`, so Vercel will auto-detect the static build and SPA rewrites.
1) Create a new Vercel project from this repo.
   - Root Directory: project root
   - Framework Preset: Vite (or Auto-detected)
   - Build Command: `npm ci && npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`
2) Set Environment Variable in Vercel Project Settings (Production and Preview):
   - VITE_API_URL=https://<your-backend-domain>/api
3) Deploy. Open the Vercel URL and log in.

### Frontend — Netlify
1) New Site from Git → choose this repo.
   - Base directory: root
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
2) Add environment variables:
   - VITE_API_URL=https://<your-backend-domain>/api
3) Deploy and test.

### Frontend — Render (Static Site)
1) Render Dashboard → New → Static Site
   - Connect GitHub and select this repo.
   - Build Command: `npm ci && npm run build`
   - Publish Directory: `dist`
2) Environment Variables (on the Static Site):
   - VITE_API_URL=https://<your-backend-domain>/api
3) Optional: SPA fallback rule in Render → Your Static Site → Redirects/Rewrites
   - Source: `/*`
   - Destination: `/index.html`
   - Action: `Rewrite`
   This ensures client-side routing works on refresh and deep links.
4) Deploy. Open the URL and log in.

Tip: You can also inject API URL at runtime without rebuild by adding a tag to index.html:

  <meta name="app:apiUrl" content="https://<your-backend-domain>/api">

The app will prefer this over VITE_API_URL if present.

## Environment variables reference

Backend (`backend/.env`):
- DATABASE_URL=postgres://USER:PASS@HOST:5432/DBNAME
- PORT=5000 (locally; cloud platforms often inject PORT)
- JWT_SECRET=your-secret
- GEMINI_API_KEY=optional for AI features

Frontend (root `.env.local` or platform env):
- VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api (or your live backend `/api` URL)

---

## Database and migrations
- The backend runs an idempotent initializer on boot (`src/init_db.ts`) that ensures required tables/columns exist.
- No manual migration step is required for pilots.

If you need seed data:
- There is a `backend/src/seed.ts` script (where present) with npm script `npm run db:seed` that uses your current `DATABASE_URL`.

---

## Security and production notes
- CORS currently allows all origins for speed. In `backend/src/index.ts` you can restrict `origin` to your frontend URL later.
- For production, use persistent object storage for uploads and set your `uploads` path to cloud storage or proxy it via the backend.
- Always use long random `JWT_SECRET` and a managed Postgres with SSL enabled.

---

## Troubleshooting
- Backend boots but DB errors: verify `DATABASE_URL`, check that the DB is reachable and allows your IP (managed services may require IP allowlists).
- 404s from frontend API calls: ensure `VITE_API_URL` points to `<backend>/api` exactly, no trailing slashes.
- CORS errors in browser console: for a pilot, backend is already `origin: '*'`. If you customized it, add your frontend origin (e.g., `https://your-frontend.vercel.app`).
- Images not showing: ensure the image URLs are built with the helper that maps to `/uploads` and that the backend is reachable publicly.

---

## Local all-in-one with Docker (optional snippet)
If you prefer Docker locally and already have an image registry, here’s a quick outline (not required for pilot):
- Build backend: `cd backend && npm ci && npm run build`
- Run Postgres as shown above
- Use a simple Node container to run `node dist/index.js` with `DATABASE_URL` env.
- Build frontend: root `npm ci && npm run build` and serve `dist/` with any static host (e.g., `npx serve dist`).
